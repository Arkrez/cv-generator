<h1>CV-Generator</h1>
<p>Made with React(create-react-app) and html2pdf this app makes it quick and easy to create a pdf of a professional resume.</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Simply fill out the fields and watch as the resume is populated with the data that you enter. Click Add x to add additional input fields. When you are done, select "Generate PDF" to create a pdf saved to your computer</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I'm planning on adding a section for links and skills. After that, I will implement a function that will allow you to change the style of the resume and pick specific colors froma color palette. And finally I would like to add a button that will allow users to reset all of their inputs.</p>
